# XtraGlimpses--Website
- XtraGlimpses Website using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, ReactJs.
- XtraGlimpses is a unique website, which shows you Trending, Top Rated Movies and TV Shows.
- XtraGlimpses shows you extra glimpses of any Movie or TV series which you might like to watch.

  * Movies <br>
    -> Trending Movies <br>
    -> Top Rated Movies
  * TV Series <br>
    -> Trending TV <br>
